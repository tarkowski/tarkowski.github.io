	<p>&ldquo;A dark room&rdquo; is a text-based, Rogue-like computer game, which starts in a dark room, where your task is to light a fire and to keep it burning. Then the scale of the game expands, and there is a world outside of the room. People enter, you gather resources, and find out that you are in a village. Suddenly your goal is to manage different aspects of the village life. Until the scale expands again, and there is a whole world to discover.</p>
<p>Great storytelling can be built on such shifts of scale, as you experience the world expanding around you in fascinating ways. This is the stuff of &ldquo;A dark room&rdquo;, but also of many great stories.</p>
<p>This also turns out to be the narrative arc of my activism.</p>
<p>Around twenty years ago, somewhere between my graduate and PhD studies, I found out about Creative Commons, Free Culture, and copyright activism. I read extensively Lawrence Lessig&rsquo;s papers, and went on to translate his &ldquo;Free Culture&rdquo; into Polish (through a collaborative process that fit well Benkler&rsquo;s definition of commons-based peer production - my Mom told me it would have been faster to ditch that bazaar, and translate it in a traditional, cathedral-style process).</p>
<p>In 2004, I co-founded the Polish chapter of Creative Commons as a volunteer, then got a job that allowed me to do this work and be paid, and by 2009 co-founded my own organization, focused on promoting things free and open. I also became at that time strongly engaged in copyright reform activism, which led me and my friends at the Communia Association to spend 5 intensive years as public interest advocates in the policy debate on the EUropean Copyright Directive.</p>
<p>In 2002–twenty years ago–I created my first blog, called &ldquo;Terminal internetyki&rdquo;, the internetics terminal. &ldquo;The terminal has the goal of monitoring and sociologically analysing changes caused by the development of new media&rdquo;, said the &ldquo;About&rdquo; page. &ldquo;We are working on launching the Polish branch of the Creative Commons project, I added on the margin.</p>
<p>The first post linked to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/weekinreview/the-nation-case-sensitive-crusader-who-owns-the-internet-you-and-i-do.html">New York Times article about Joseph Turow</a>, a researcher who decided to stop capitalizing the word &ldquo;Internet&rdquo;. Turow argued that the internet was not a &ldquo;brand-name experience&rdquo;, but a &ldquo;part of the everyday universe&rdquo;. The text also mentions Robert Kahn, one of internet&rsquo;s co-creators, who was at that time defending &ldquo;the right of people to use the word &lsquo;Internet&rsquo; for what we think of as the Internet&rdquo;, against some trademarking attempt by an IPR maximalist company.</p>
<p>This clearly struck a note. I summarized the article, and then added: &ldquo;We can speak about the Internet, the internet or even the internets. Alongside the one medium, a great and common telecommunications spidernet, there are, after all, private mental spaces, internets belonging to each of us, the users of the internet&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Reading this today, I&rsquo;m surprised how close my thoughts were back then to what I find interesting and important today. And how very <a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indieweb</a> it was, although I did not know the term at that time.</p>
