## Hello! My name is Alek Tarkowski. I am a sociologist, strategist and digital activist. 

## My current goal is to imagine, understand, and describe the [New Open](http://paradox.openfuture.eu/). 

## I work at the [Open Future Foundation](http://openfuture.eu), the think tank for an open movement. 

## This is my homepage on the [indieweb](http://alektarkowski.pl/posts/my-home-on-the-indieweb/).
